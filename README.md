## Branch CoreNodeJS
- Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server side, enabling you to build scalable network applications.

- NPM (Node Package Manager)
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js.It helps you manage dependencies for your projects and provides a vast repository of packages that you can use to add functionality to your applications.

- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods. JavaScript supports OOP through prototypes and ES6 classes.

- Event Loop
The event loop is a mechanism in Node.jsthat handles asynchronous operations. It allows Node.jsto perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading tasks to the system kernel whenever possible.


- Type Conversions
Type conversions in JavaScript can be implicit or explicit. Implicit conversions happen automatically, while explicit conversions use functions like Number(), String(), and Boolean() to convert values.

- "use strict"
The "use strict" directive is used to enable strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions, such as defining global variables.

- Comparisons
JavaScript provides both strict (===) and loose (==) equality operators. The strict equality operator checks both value and type, while the loose equality operator performs type conversion before comparison.

- Conditional Branching
Conditional branching in JavaScript is done using if, else if, and else statements, as well as the switch statement for multiple conditions.

- Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm
alert(): Displays a message to the user.

prompt(): Asks the user for input and returns the input value.

confirm(): Asks the user to confirm an action and returns true or false.

- Logical & Nullish Coalescing Operator
Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to perform logical operations.

The nullish coalescing operator (??) returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is null or undefined.

- Polyfills and Transpilers
Polyfills are pieces of code that provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

Transpilers like Babel convert modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with older environments.

- Recursion and Stack
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself. The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a program.

- Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax
Rest parameters (...args) allow you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

- Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments are expected.

- Variable Scope
Variable scope determines the accessibility of variables. JavaScript has function scope, block scope (with let and const), and global scope.

- Closure
A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This allows for data encapsulation and private variables.
